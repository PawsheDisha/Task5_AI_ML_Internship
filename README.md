# Task5_AI_ML_Internship

📌 Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

🎯 Objective

To understand and implement tree-based machine learning models for classification using Decision Tree and Random Forest, analyze overfitting, interpret feature importance, and evaluate performance using cross-validation.
📂 Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes used to predict whether a patient has heart disease (target variable).

    Target: 0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease

    Features include age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

    Python

    Pandas

    NumPy

    Scikit-learn

    Matplotlib

    Graphviz (for tree visualization)

🔎 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

    Loaded dataset using pandas

    Checked for missing values

    Split data into features (X) and target (y)

    Performed train-test split (80:20)

2️⃣ Decision Tree Model

    Trained DecisionTreeClassifier

    Evaluated accuracy

    Visualized the tree structure

    Analyzed overfitting by comparing train and test accuracy

3️⃣ Overfitting Control

    Controlled tree depth using max_depth

    Used min_samples_split

    Observed improvement in generalization

4️⃣ Random Forest Model

    Trained RandomForestClassifier

    Compared accuracy with Decision Tree

    Observed better performance due to ensemble learning

5️⃣ Feature Importance

    Extracted feature importance scores

    Plotted bar graph to interpret influential features

    Identified most important medical factors contributing to prediction

6️⃣ Cross-Validation

    Applied 5-fold cross-validation

    Calculated average accuracy for reliable model evaluation

📊 Results

    Random Forest performed better than a single Decision Tree

    Controlled tree depth reduced overfitting

    Feature importance helped identify key predictors

📚 Concepts Learned

    Decision Tree algorithm

    Entropy and Information Gain

    Overfitting and pruning

    Ensemble learning (Bagging)

    Random Forest

    Feature Importance

    Cross-validation

🚀 Conclusion

Tree-based models are powerful and interpretable machine learning techniques. While Decision Trees are easy to visualize and understand, Random Forest improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by combining multiple trees.

If you want, I can also give:

    🔹 A shorter version (if internship requires 5–6 lines only)

    🔹 A more technical version

    🔹 Add screenshots section for GitHub submission

    🔹 Add installation & run instructions

Tell me what your internship submission format requires.

how to add bullets in github readme

ChatGPT said:

GitHub README files use Markdown, and bullets are very simple to add.

Here are the correct ways:
✅ 1️⃣ Basic Bullet Points

Use - (hyphen), * (asterisk), or +

Example:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

OR

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas

👉 All three give the same result.
✅ 2️⃣ Nested Bullets (Sub-points)

Add 2 spaces before the symbol:

- Machine Learning
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Cross Validation

Output:

    Machine Learning

        Decision Tree

        Random Forest

        Cross Validation

✅ 3️⃣ Numbered List

Use numbers followed by a dot:

1. Load dataset
2. Train Decision Tree
3. Train Random Forest
4. Evaluate Model

✅ 4️⃣ Checklist (Very Useful for Internship Tasks)

- [x] Load dataset
- [x] Train Decision Tree
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Add visualization

Output:

    Load dataset

    Train Decision Tree

    Hyperparameter tuning

    Add visualization

🚀 How to Add in GitHub

    Open your repository

    Click README.md

    Click ✏ Edit

    Add bullets using -

    Scroll down → Commit changes

If you want, send your README content and I’ll format it properly with clean bullets and indentation so it looks professional.
